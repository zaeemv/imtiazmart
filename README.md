  - Implement basic Kafka consumers to handle these events.
- **Components:**
  - Kafka configuration and setup.
  - Kafka producer and consumer implementation in user and product services.

#### Day 6: Serialization and Deserialization
- **Tasks:**
  - Define Protobuf schemas for the events.
  - Integrate Protobuf with Kafka producers and consumers in the existing services.
- **Components:**
  - Protobuf schema files.
  - Protobuf integration in user and product services.

#### Day 7: API Gateway Setup
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up Kong API Gateway.
  - Configure Kong to route requests to the user and product services.
  - Implement basic authentication and rate limiting in Kong.
- **Components:**
  - Kong configuration for routing.
  - Kong plugins for authentication and rate limiting.

### Week 2

#### Day 8: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Tasks:**
  - Write unit tests for the user and product services.
  - Ensure tests cover critical functionalities (e.g., user registration, product addition).
  - Set up a continuous testing environment.
- **Components:**
  - Unit tests for user and product services.
  - Test configuration and setup.

#### Day 9: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- **Tasks:**
  - Write feature files and scenarios for key user stories (e.g., user can register, user can view products).
  - Implement corresponding step definitions.
  - Run BDD tests to ensure scenarios pass.
- **Components:**
  - Feature files for BDD.
  - Step definitions and BDD test implementation.

#### Day 10: Advanced Microservice Implementation
- **Tasks:**
  - Develop the order processing service with endpoints for placing and viewing orders.
  - Develop the inventory management service with endpoints for managing stock levels.
  - Ensure these services are containerized and integrated with Kafka.
- **Components:**
  - Order processing microservice.
  - Inventory management microservice.

#### Day 11: Deployment Configuration
- **Tasks:**
  - Write Dockerfiles for the order processing and inventory management services.
  - Update the Docker Compose configuration to include all services.
  - Ensure all services can be brought up and communicate with each other.
- **Components:**
  - Dockerfiles for new services.
  - Updated `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Day 12: Monitoring and Logging
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up Prometheus to monitor service metrics.
  - Set up Grafana to visualize metrics.
  - Implement centralized logging using a logging framework (e.g., ELK stack).
- **Components:**
  - Prometheus and Grafana setup.
  - Centralized logging configuration.

#### Day 13: Continuous Delivery Setup
- **Tasks:**
  - Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI).
  - Set up workflows for building, testing, and deploying the code.
  - Ensure deployments are automated and trigger on code changes.
- **Components:**
  - GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

#### Day 14: Final Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Tasks:**
  - Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire system.
  - Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle high volumes of transactions.
  - Review the codebase for improvements and ensure best practices are followed.
- **Components:**
  - End-to-end test scripts.
  - Load testing tools and scripts.
  - Code review and refinement.

This detailed plan will guide you through the development of the Online Imtiaz Mart API, ensuring a systematic approach to building a robust, scalable, and efficient system.
